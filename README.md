# Movie Sagas

## Description
This is a basic CRUD app. It exists as a Movie Poster Gallery! It has the ability to do this:
- C | Create | POST | insert
- R | Read | GET | select
- U | Update | PUT | update
- D | Delete | DELETE | delete

The user can READ the current data by visiting the home page and browsing the Movie Poster Gallery. The also have the access to CREATE their own poster, with title, genre, and description through a form. If the user were to enter the wrong information or would prefer to make some updates, the user can UPDATE the movie entry through the edit form on the details page. This edit form autopopulates the input fields with the most recent details in the details store, which would be for the movie the user is making edits on. DELETE a movie is an option that is provided to the user to make this a full CRUD app, in case of duplicates or sudden hatred for a certain film.
